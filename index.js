//understands the problem
//we're creating a function that works like a calculator
//function has no parameters
//Argument passed should be either "plus" or minus
//Instead we will use the process.argv
//We need to write "plus" or "Minus" in our terminal(command)in order for the numbers to be added

//Remember that the first and second elements of process.argv are always the path to the node program and the filepath.
//Remember that each argument from the command line will be read in as a string. You will need some way to convert the inputs from strings to numbers.
//Because you don't know how many numbers will be passed in, you may need to iterate over the numbers.
